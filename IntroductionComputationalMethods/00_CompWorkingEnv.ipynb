    "## Common Language Options for Scientific Computing\n",
    "Various high-level *specialized programming languages* have been developed with a focus on *scientific applications*.\n",
    "They typically have their origin in a specific user community and provide abstractions and functionalities tailored to this community and its scientific domain.\n",
    "Typical examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html): Focus on numerical computing for science & engineering. Proprietary, requires license.\n",
    "*   [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/): Numerical computation, high compatibility to Matlab,  Open source.\n",
    "*   [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org): Numerical computation, Open source. \n",
    "*   [R](https://www.r-project.org): Focus on statistical computing. Open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these are [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) languages (instead of [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) languages), providing an interactive user experience (at some cost to speed), which facilitates incremental code development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last years, also the following high-level *general purpose languages* have become increasingly popular for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   [Python](https://www.python.org): General purpose, Open source.\n",
    "*   [Julia](https://julialang.org): General purpose, Open source. \n",
    "\n",
    "These languages offer a similar interactive programming experience as the specialized languages listed above and are backed by a large developer and user community.\n",
    "Although designed as general purpose languages, their functionality is easily extended by external libraries for specific aspects of scientific computing."

    "We will use [Python](https://www.python.org) to introduce basic programming concepts and for most of the computational exercises in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **interpreted**, **high-level**, **general-purpose** programming language.\n",
    "Its reference implementation is **open source** software managed by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).\n",
    "Development on Python started in the late 1980s and the very first release dates back to 1991. \n",
    "In case you wonder about the name, it has nothing to do with reptiles but is a tribute to the [Monty Python Flying Circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python) ([see FAQ](https://docs.python.org/2/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a large [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) that provides functionalities for a wide range of application domains. \n",
    "Most extensions and community-contributed software modules are indexed in the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org), the official repository of third-party Python libraries.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, note that there is **no need to install Python** for this course; see *Python without Installation* below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, [ANACONDA](https://www.anaconda.com/download) provides a full featured Python environment that is [easy to install](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on all operating systems. It bundles the basic python interpreter with additional tools, such as [IPython](https://ipython.org), an interactive interpreter, [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org), an IDE for scientific python development, and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) for browser-based interactive programming notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks can contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. They can be shared as static (see [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) examples) or interactive (see this [example](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/master?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fdemo%2FLorenz.ipynb)) documents containing text and executable code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python without Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "*Colab* is a Google service that is compatible to Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "Provided an active internet connection, Jupyter notebooks can be opened, edited and executed. Also, they can be saved to Google Drive, be shared and downloaded.\n",
