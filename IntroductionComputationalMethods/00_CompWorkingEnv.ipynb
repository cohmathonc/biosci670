    "## Common Language Options for Scientific Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental role of computational tools is to facilitate repetitive arithmetic tasks and visualization.\n",
    "Many programming languages provide this basic functionality -- so there is plenty of choice.\n",
    "This choice usually involves a trade-off between computational speed during execution and ease-of-use during development. Other criteria may include whether libraries are available that facilitate specific computational tasks or whether the language implementation is open source or proprietary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally intensive aspects of scientific computing typically rely on [*compiled*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) *general purpose languages*, such as [*C*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) or [*Fortran*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) and optimized software libraries for numeric computing.\n",
    "When computational speed is not the foremost concern, [*interpreted*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) languages are usually preferred because they allow a more 'interactive' style of programming which facilitates incremental code development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various specialized interpreted languages have been developed with focus on *scientific applications*.\n",
    "They typically originate from a specific user community and provide abstractions and functionalities tailored to its scientific domain.\n",
    "Common examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html): Focus on numerical computing for science & engineering. Proprietary, requires license.\n",
    "*   [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/): Numerical computation, high compatibility to Matlab,  Open source.\n",
    "*   [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org): Numerical computation, Open source. \n",
    "*   [R](https://www.r-project.org): Focus on statistical computing. Open source.\n",
    "*   [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/): Many areas of technical computing. Proprietary, requires license.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last years, also the following *general purpose languages* have become increasingly popular for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   [Python](https://www.python.org): General purpose, Open source.\n",
    "*   [Julia](https://julialang.org): General, some focus on scientific and numerical computing, Open source. \n",
    "\n",
    "These languages offer a similar interactive programming experience as the specialized languages listed above.\n",
    "Although designed as general purpose languages, a large ecosystem of 'external' libraries allows their functionality to be easily extended for specific aspects of scientific computing.\n"

    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [Python](https://www.python.org) to introduce basic programming concepts and for most of the computational exercises in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **high-level**, **interpreted**, **general-purpose** programming language.\n",
    "Its reference implementation is **open source** software managed by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).\n",
    "Development on Python started in the late 1980s and the very first release dates back to 1991. \n",
    "In case you wonder about the name, it has nothing to do with reptiles but is a tribute to the [Monty Python Flying Circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python) ([see FAQ](https://docs.python.org/2/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a large [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) that provides functionalities for a wide range of application domains. \n",
    "Most extensions and community-contributed software modules are indexed in the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org), the official repository of third-party Python libraries.\n",
    "This rich ecosystem makes Python one of the [most popular](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) programming languages today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two major release versions of Python are commonly being used today, version `2.x` (typically `2.7.x`) and version `3.x` (latest `3.7.x`). We will be using version `3.7`. Refer to this [discussion](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) about differences between those versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Installation Options\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that there is **no need to install Python** for this course; see *Python without Installation* below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic Python interpreter comes pre-installed on most linux systems and on MacOS. You can check whether it is available on your system by typing `python` in a terminal or command line window.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do want to set up a local installation and this is your first Python experience, I would recommend to install [ANACONDA](https://www.anaconda.com/download) which provides a full featured Python environment that is [easy to install](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Choose the `Python 3.x` installation option.\n",
    "ANACONDA bundles the basic python interpreter with additional tools, such as [IPython](https://ipython.org), an interactive interpreter, [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org), an *integrated development environment* (IDE) for scientific python programming (similar to Matlab or RStudio for R), and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) for browser-based interactive programming notebooks.\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks can contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. They can be shared as static (see [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) examples) or interactive (see this [example](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/master?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fdemo%2FLorenz.ipynb)) documents containing text and executable code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about installing the basic python interpreter is available [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python without Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of using a popular open-source programming language is the availability of free tools and services, including various options for editing and programming online.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) gives you access to an online Python or IPython console. \n",
    "[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a Google service that is compatible to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) Notebooks and allows these notebooks to be opened, edited and executed online. Notebooks can be saved to Google Drive, be shared like other files on google drive and, of course, be downloaded.\n",
    "Microsoft offers a similar service called [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com).\n",
    "[Binder](https://mybinder.org) is another project that can turn Jupyter Notebooks into an executable online-environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will be using Jupyter Notebooks in this course**, the **easiest way to access and edit** these Notebooks is probably via **Colab**.
